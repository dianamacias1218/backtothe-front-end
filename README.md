# Back to the front-end - Final Project: MERN Stack Single-Page Application

## Description

This project is a showcase of our collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. This project will help show employers what we can do as a team and how we work with other developers. We understand that the more examples of deployed collaborative work we have in your portfolio, the more likely we are to get an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements

Our group used everything weâ€™ve learned throughout the fullstack bootcamp course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project provides us with the best opportunity to demonstrate our problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. 

Our project requirements were as follows:

- Use React for the front end.

- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Include authentication (JWT).

- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
